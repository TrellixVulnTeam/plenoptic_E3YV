    r"""Structural similarity index

    As described in [1]_, the structural similarity index (SSIM) is a
    perceptual distance metric, giving the distance between two images. SSIM is
    based on three comparison measurements between the two images: luminance,
    contrast, and structure. All of these are computed in windows across the
    images. See the references for more information.

    This implementation follows the original implementation, as found at [2]_,
    as well as providing the option to use the weighted version used in [4]_
    (which was shown to consistently improve the image quality prediction on
    the LIVE database).

    Note that this is a similarity metric (not a distance), and so 1 means the
    two images are identical and 0 means they're very different. It is bounded
    between 0 and 1.

    This function returns the mean SSIM, a scalar-valued metric giving the
    average over the whole image. For the SSIM map (showing the computed value
    across the image), call `ssim_map`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img1 : torch.Tensor
        4d tensor with first image to compare
    img2 : torch.Tensor
        4d tensor with second image to compare. Must have the same height and
        width (last two dimensions) as `img1`
    weighted : bool, optional
        whether to use the original, unweighted SSIM version (`False`) as used
        in [1]_ or the weighted version (`True`) as used in [4]_. See Notes
        section for the weight
    dynamic_range : int, optional.
        dynamic range of the images. Note we assume that both images have the
        same dynamic range. 1, the default, is appropriate for float images
        between 0 and 1, as is common in synthesis. 2 is appropriate for float

        integer images. We'll raise a warning if it looks like your value is
        not appropriate for `img1` or `img2`, but will calculate it anyway.

    Returns
    ------
    mssim : torch.Tensor
        2d tensor containing the mean SSIM for each image, averaged over the
        whole image

    Notes
    -----
    The weight used when `weighted=True` is:

    .. math::
       \log((1+\frac{\sigma_1^2}{C_2})(1+\frac{\sigma_2^2}{C_2}))

    where :math:`sigma_1^2` and :math:`sigma_2^2` are the variances of `img1`
    and `img2`, respectively, and :math:`C_2` is a constant which depends on
    `dynamic_range`. See [4]_ for more details.

    As described in  [1]_, this is an image quality metric based on the transformations associated with the early

    A laplacian pyramid subtracts a local estimate of the mean luminance at six scales.

    in spatial neighborhood.

    These weights parameters were optimized for redundancy reduction over an training
    database of (undistorted) natural images.
