class MADCompetition(Synthesis):
    """Generate maximally-differentiating images for two models

    In MAD Competition, we start with a reference image and generate two
    pairs of images. We end up with two pairs of images, one of which
    contains the images which produce the largest and smallest responses
    in model 1 while keeping model 2's response as close to constant as
    possible, while the other pair of images does the inverse
    (differentiates model 2's responses as much as possible while
    keeping model 1's response as close to constant as possible).

    Note: a complete set of MAD Competition stimuli consists of four
    synthesized images per base image. We modularize this so that a
    call to ``synthesis()`` gets you one of the four images (by setting
    the ``synthesis_target`` arg, you determine which one). You can get
    the full set by calling ``synthesis()`` four times with different
    args (allowing you to parallelize however you see fit), or by
    calling ``synthesize_all()``.

    Note that for many attributes (e.g., `loss`, `synthesized_signal`), there are
    two versions, on with `_1` as a suffix and one with `_2`. This is because
    we need to store those attributes for each model: the version that ends in
    `_1` corresponds to `model_1` and the one that ends in `_2` corresponds to
    `model_2`. Similarly, many of these have a version that ends in `_all`,
    which is a dictionary containing that attribute for each synthesis target
    (some, such as `loss`, have both of these). See `MAD_Competition` notebook
    for more details.

    There are two types of objects you can pass as your models: torch.nn.Module
    or functions, which correspond to using a visual model or metric,
    respectively. See the `MAD_Competition` notebook for more details on this.

    All ``saved_`` attributes are initialized as empty lists and will be
    non-empty if the ``store_progress`` arg to ``synthesize()`` is not
    ``False``. They will be appended to on every iteration if
    ``store_progress=True`` or every ``store_progress`` iterations if it's an
    ``int``.

    All ``scales`` attributes will only be non-None if ``coarse_to_fine`` is
    not ``False``. See ``Metamer`` tutorial for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_signal : torch.Tensor or array_like
        A 4d tensor, this is the image whose representation we wish to
        match. If this is not a tensor, we try to cast it as one.
    model_1, model_2 : torch.nn.Module or function
        The two visual models or metrics to compare, see `MAD_Competition`
        notebook for more details
    loss_function : callable or None, optional
        the loss function to use to compare the representations of the
        models in order to determine their loss. Only used for the
        Module models, ignored otherwise. If None, we use the default:
        the element-wise 2-norm. See `MAD_Competition` notebook for more
        details
    model_1_kwargs, model_2_kwargs : dict
        if model_1 or model_2 are functions (that is, you're using a
        metric instead of a model), then there might be additional
        arguments you want to pass it at run-time. Those should be
        included in a dictionary as ``key: value`` pairs. Note that this
        means they will be passed on every call.

    Attributes
    ----------
    base_signal : torch.Tensor
        A 2d tensor, this is the image whose representation we wish to
        match.
    model_1, model_2 : torch.nn.Module
        Two differentiable model that takes an image as an input and
        transforms it into a representation of some sort. We only
        require that they have a forward method, which returns the
        representation to match.
    base_representation_1, base_representation_2 : torch.Tensor
        Whatever is returned by ``model_1`` and ``model_2``
        ``forward(base_signal)`` methods, respectively. This is the
        representation we're trying to get as close or far away from as
        possible when targeting a given model.
    initial_image : torch.Tensor
        base_signal with white noise added to it (and clamped, if
        applicable), this is the starting point of our synthesis
    synthesized_signal : torch.Tensor
        The synthesized image from the last call to
        ``synthesis()``. This may be unfinished depending on how many
        iterations we've run for.
    synthesized_represetation_1, synthesized_representation_2: torch.Tensor
        Whatever is returned by ``model_1`` and ``model_2``
        ``forward(synthesized_signal)``, respectively.
    seed : int
        Number with which to seed pytorch and numy's random number
        generators
    loss_1, loss_2 : list
        list of the loss with respect to model_1, model_2 over
        iterations.
    gradient : list
        list containing the gradient over iterations
    learning_rate : list
        list containing the learning_rate over iterations. We use a
        scheduler that gradually reduces this over time, so it won't be
        constant.
    pixel_change : list
        A list containing the max pixel change over iterations
        (``pixel_change[i]`` is the max pixel change in
        ``synthesized_signal`` between iterations ``i`` and ``i-1``). note
        this is calculated before any clamping, so may have some very
        large numbers in the beginning
    nu : list
        list containing the nu parameter over iterations. Nu is the
        parameter used to correct the image so that the other model's
        representation will not change; see docstring of
        ``self._find_nu()`` for more details
    saved_signal : torch.Tensor or list
        Saved ``self.synthesized_signal`` for later examination.
    saved_representation : torch.Tensor or list
        Saved ``self.synthesized_representation`` for later examination.
    saved_signal_gradient : torch.Tensor or list
        Saved ``self.synthesized_signal.grad`` for later examination.
    saved_representation_gradient : torch.Tensor or list
        Saved ``self.synthesized_representation.grad`` for later examination.
    scales : list or None
        The list of scales in optimization order (i.e., from coarse to fine).
        Will be modified during the course of optimization.
    scales_loss : list or None
        The scale-specific loss at each iteration
    scales_timing : dict or None
        Keys are the values found in ``scales``, values are lists, specifying
        the iteration where we started and stopped optimizing this scale.
    scales_finished : list or None
        List of scales that we've finished optimizing.

        model_2's level set. Projecting out model_2's gradient from
        model_1's gradient (which we do in ``_closure()``) helps with
        this, but it's not perfect.

        Call ``grad`` :math:`G`, ``base_signal`` :math:`X` and the
        synthesized image on iteration n :math:`Y_{n}` (and thus

        Appendix C for details).

        We do this using a brief optimization, using Adam with a
        learning rate scheduler. We minimize the above loss, doing
        several iterations to try and find the best nu (number of
        iterations set by ``n_iter``). During each iteration, we have to

        grad : torch.Tensor
            the gradient of ``self.synthesized_signal`` for model 2 with

            if we're resuming synthesis, in which case we use the last
            learning rate from the previous instance.
        scheduler : bool, optional
            whether to initialize the scheduler or not. If False, the
            learning rate will never decrease.
        optimizer: {'GD', 'Adam', 'SGD', 'LBFGS', 'AdamW'}
            The choice of optimization algorithm. 'GD' is regular
            gradient descent.
        optimizer_kwargs : dict, optional
            Dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the optimizer (in
            addition to learning_rate). What these should be depend on
            the specific optimizer you're using
        clamper : plenoptic.Clamper or None, optional
            Clamper makes a change to the image in order to ensure that
            it stays reasonable. The classic example (and default
            option) is making sure the range lies between 0 and 1, see
            plenoptic.RangeClamper for an example.
        clamp_each_iter : bool, optional
            If True (and ``clamper`` is not ``None``), we clamp every
            iteration. If False, we only clamp at the very end, after
            the last iteration
        store_progress : bool or int, optional
            Whether we should store the representation of the metamer
            and the metamer image in progress on every iteration. If
            False, we don't save anything. If True, we save every
            iteration. If an int, we save every ``store_progress``
            iterations (note then that 0 is the same as False and 1 the
            same as True).
        save_progress : bool or int, optional
            Whether to save the metamer as we go. If True, we save to
            ``save_path`` every ``store_progress`` iterations. If an int, we
            save every ``save_progress`` iterations. Note that this can end up
            actually taking a fair amount of time.
        save_path : str, optional
            The path to save the synthesis-in-progress to (ignored if
            ``save_progress`` is False)
        loss_thresh : float, optional
            If the loss over the past ``loss_change_iter`` has changed
            less than ``loss_thresh``, we stop.
        loss_change_iter : int, optional
            How many iterations back to check in order to see if the
            loss has stopped decreasing (for loss_change_thresh).
        loss_change_thresh : float, optional
            The threshold below which we consider the loss as unchanging and so
            should switch scales if `coarse_to_fine is not False`. Ignored
            otherwise.
        coarse_to_fine : { 'together', 'separate', False}, optional
            If False, don't do coarse-to-fine optimization. Else, there
            are two options for how to do it:
            - 'together': start with the coarsest scale, then gradually
              add each finer scale.
            - 'separate': compute the gradient with respect to each
              scale separately (ignoring the others), then with respect
              to all of them at the end.
            (see ``Metamer`` tutorial for more details).
        clip_grad_norm : bool or float, optional
            Clip the gradient norm to avoid issues with numerical overflow.
            Gradient norm will be clipped to the specified value (True is
            equivalent to 1).

        that's the main target (e.g., if

        We plot ``self.representation_error(iteration)``

        The goal is to use the model's ``plot_representation``
        method. However, in order for this to work, it needs to not only
        have that method, but a way to make a 'mock copy', a separate
        model that has the same initialization parameters, but whose
        representation we can set. For the VentralStream models, we can
        do this using their ``state_dict_reduced`` attribute. If we can't
        do this, then we'll fall back onto using ``plt.plot``

        In order for this to work, we also count on
        ``plot_representation`` to return the figure and the axes it
        modified (axes should be a list)

        If ``iteration`` is not None, we use
        ``self.saved_representation[iteration]`` for
        synthesized_representation..

        Since a single MADCompetition instance can be used for
        synthesizing multiple targets, you can specify the target as
        well. If None, we use the current target of the synthesis.

        MADCompetition also has two models, and we will plot the
        representation error for both of them, on separate subplots
        (titling them appropriately).

        Regardless, we always reset the target state to what it was
        before this was called

        Parameters
        ----------
        synthesis_target : {None, 'model_1_min', 'model_1_max', 'model_2_min', 'model_2_max'}

        batch_idx : int, optional
            Which index to take from the batch dimension
        iteration: int or None, optional
            Which iteration to create the representation ratio for. If
            None, we use the current ``synthesized_representation``
        figsize : tuple, optional
            The size of the figure to create
        ylim : tuple or None, optional
            If not None, the y-limits to use for this plot. If None, we
            scale the y-limits so that it's symmetric about 0 with a
            limit of ``np.abs(representation_error).max()``
        ax : matplotlib.pyplot.axis or None, optional
            If not None, the axis to plot this representation on. If
            None, we create our own 2 subplot figure to hold it
        title : str, optional
            The title to put above this axis. If you want no title, pass
            the empty string (``''``)
        as_rgb : bool, optional
            The representation can be image-like with multiple channels, and we
            have no way to determine whether it should be represented as an RGB
            image or not, so the user must set this flag to tell us. It will be
            ignored if the representation doesn't look image-like or if the
            model has its own plot_representation_error() method. Else, it will
            be passed to `po.imshow()`, see that methods docstring for details.

        r"""Make a plot showing synthesized image, loss, and (optionally) representation ratio.

        We create several subplots to analyze this. By default, we create three
        subplots on a new figure: the first one contains the synthesized image,
        the second contains the loss, and the third contains the representation
        error.

        There are several optional additional plots: image_hist, rep_comparison, and
        signal_comparison:

        - image_hist contains a histogram of pixel values of the synthesized
          and base images.

        - rep_comparison is a scatter plot comparing the representation of the
          synthesized and base images.

        - signal_comparison is a scatter plot (by default) or 2d histogram (if
          signal_comp_func='hist2d') of the pixel values in the synthesized and
          base images.

        All of these (including the default plots) can be toggled using their
        corresponding boolean flags, and can be created separately using the
        method with the same name as the flag.

        We use ``pyrtools.imshow`` to display the synthesized image and
        attempt to automatically find the most reasonable zoom
        value. You can override this value using the imshow_zoom arg,
        but remember that ``pyrtools.imshow`` is opinionated about the
        size of the resulting image and will throw an Exception if the
        axis created is not big enough for the selected zoom. We
        currently cannot shrink the image, so figsize must be big enough
        to display the image

        Since a single MADCompetition instance can be used for
        synthesizing multiple targets, you can specify the target as
        well. If None, we use the current target of the synthesis.

        Regardless, we always reset the target state to what it was
        before this was called.

        MADCompetition also has two models, and we will plot the loss for both
        of them, on the same subplot (labelling them appropriately). The
        rep_comparison and representation_error plots will take up 2 subplots
        (one for each model), if created.

        Parameters
        ----------
        synthesis_target : {None, 'model_1_min', 'model_1_max', 'model_2_min', 'model_2_max'}
            which synthesis target to grab the representation for. If
            None, we use the most recent synthesis_target (i.e.,
            ``self.synthesis_target``).
        batch_idx : int, optional
            Which index to take from the batch dimension
        channel_idx : int or None, optional
            Which index to take from the channel dimension. If None, we use all
            channels (assumed use-case is RGB(A) image).
        iteration : int or None, optional
            Which iteration to display. If None, the default, we show
            the most recent one. Negative values are also allowed.
        figsize : tuple or None, optional
            The size of the figure to create. It may take a little bit of
            playing around to find a reasonable value. If None, we attempt to
            make our best guess, aiming to have each axis be of size (5, 5)
        ylim : tuple or None, optional
            The ylimit to use for the representation_error plot. We pass
            this value directly to ``self.plot_representation_error``
        plot_representation_error : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the representation ratio or not.
        imshow_zoom : None or float, optional
            How much to zoom in / enlarge the synthesized image, the ratio
            of display pixels to image pixels. If None (the default), we
            attempt to find the best value ourselves. Else, if >1, must
            be an integer.  If <1, must be 1/d where d is a a divisor of
            the size of the largest image.
        vrange : tuple or str, optional
            The vrange option to pass to ``pyrtools.imshow``. See that
            function for details
        fig : None or matplotlib.pyplot.Figure
            if None, we create a new figure. otherwise we assume this is
            an empty figure that has the appropriate size and number of
            subplots
        plot_image_hist : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the histograms of image pixel intensities or
            not.
        plot_rep_comparison : bool, optional
            Whether to plot a scatter plot comparing the synthesized and base
            representation.
        plot_signal_comparison : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the comparison of the synthesized and base
            signal.
        signal_comp_func : {'scatter', 'hist2d'}, optional
            Whether to use a scatter plot or 2d histogram to plot this signal
            comparison. When there are many values (as often happens), then
            hist2d will be clearer
        signal_comp_subsample : float, optional
            What percentage of signal points to plot. If less than 1, will
            randomly select that proportion of the points to plot. Done to make

            Dictionary specifying which axes contains which type of plot,
            allows for more fine-grained control of the resulting figure.
            Probably only helpful if fig is also defined. Possible keys: image,
            loss, rep_error, hist, rep_comp, signal_comp, misc. Values should
            all be ints. If you tell this function to create a plot that doesn't
            have a corresponding key, we find the lowest int that is not
            already in the dict, so if you have axes that you want unchanged,
            place their idx in misc.
        plot_representation_error_as_rgb : bool, optional
            The representation can be image-like with multiple channels, and we
            have no way to determine whether it should be represented as an RGB
            image or not, so the user must set this flag to tell us. It will be
            ignored if the representation doesn't look image-like or if the
            model has its own plot_representation_error() method. Else, it will
            be passed to `po.imshow()`, see that methods docstring for details.
        width_ratios : dict, optional
            By defualt, all plots axes will have the same width. To change
            that, specify their relative widths using keys of the format
            "{x}_width", where `x` in ['synthesized_image', 'loss',

        This is essentially the figure produced by
        ``self.plot_synthesis_status`` animated over time, for each stored
        iteration.

        We return the matplotlib FuncAnimation object. In order to view
        it in a Jupyter notebook, use the
        ``plenoptic.convert_anim_to_html(anim)`` function. In order to
        save, use ``anim.save(filename)`` (note for this that you'll
        need the appropriate writer installed and on your path, e.g.,
        ffmpeg, imagemagick, etc). Either of these will probably take a
        reasonably long amount of time.

        Since a single MADCompetition instance can be used for
        synthesizing multiple targets, you can specify the target as
        well. If None, we use the current target of the synthesis.

        Regardless, we always reset the target state to what it was
        before this was called.

        MADCompetition also has two models, and we will plot the loss for both
        of them, on the same subplot (labelling them appropriately). The
        rep_comparison and representation_error plots will each take up 2
        subplots (one for each model), if created.

        Parameters
        ----------
        synthesis_target : {None, 'model_1_min', 'model_1_max', 'model_2_min', 'model_2_max'}
            which synthesis target to grab the representation for. If
            None, we use the most recent synthesis_target (i.e.,
            ``self.synthesis_target``).
        batch_idx : int, optional
            Which index to take from the batch dimension
        channel_idx : int or None, optional
            Which index to take from the channel dimension. If None, we use all
            channels (assumed use-case is RGB(A) image).
        figsize : tuple or None, optional
            The size of the figure to create. It may take a little bit of
            playing around to find a reasonable value. If None, we attempt to
            make our best guess, aiming to have each axis be of size (5, 5)
        framerate : int, optional
            How many frames a second to display.
        ylim : str, None, or tuple, optional
            The y-limits of the representation_error plot (ignored if
            ``plot_representation_error`` arg is False).

            * If a tuple, then this is the ylim of all plots

            * If None, then all plots have the same limits, all
              symmetric about 0 with a limit of
              ``np.abs(representation_error).max()`` (for the initial
              representation_error)

            * If a string, must be 'rescale' or of the form 'rescaleN',
              where N can be any integer. If 'rescaleN', we rescale the
              limits every N frames (we rescale as if ylim = None). If
              'rescale', then we do this 10 times over the course of the
              animation

        plot_representation_error : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the representation ratio or not.
        imshow_zoom : int, float, or None, optional
            Either an int or an inverse power of 2, how much to zoom the
            images by in the plots we'll create. If None (the default), we
            attempt to find the best value ourselves.
        plot_image_hist : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the histograms of image pixel intensities or
            not. Note that we update this in the most naive way possible
            (by clearing and replotting the values), so it might not
            look as good as the others and may take some time.
        plot_rep_comparison : bool, optional
            Whether to plot a scatter plot comparing the synthesized and base
            representation.
        plot_signal_comparison : bool, optional
            Whether to plot a 2d histogram comparing the synthesized and base
            representation. Note that we update this in the most naive way
            possible (by clearing and replotting the values), so it might not
            look as good as the others and may take some time.
        fig : plt.Figure or None, optional
            If None, create the figure from scratch. Else, should be an empty
            figure with enough axes (the expected use here is have same-size
            movies with different plots).
        signal_comp_func : {'scatter', 'hist2d'}, optional
            Whether to use a scatter plot or 2d histogram to plot this signal
            comparison. When there are many values (as often happens), then
            hist2d will be clearer
        signal_comp_subsample : float, optional
            What percentage of signal points to plot. If less than 1, will
            randomly select that proportion of the points to plot. Done to make
            visualization clearer.
        axes_idx : dict, optional
            Dictionary specifying which axes contains which type of plot,
            allows for more fine-grained control of the resulting figure.
            Probably only helpful if fig is also defined. Possible keys: image,
            loss, rep_error, hist, rep_comp, signal_comp, misc. Values should
            all be ints. If you tell this function to create a plot that doesn't
            have a corresponding key, we find the lowest int that is not
            already in the dict, so if you have axes that you want unchanged,
            place their idx in misc.
        init_figure : bool, optional
            If True, we call plot_synthesis_status to initialize the figure. If
            False, we assume fig has already been intialized with the proper
            plots (e.g., you already called plot_synthesis_status and are
            passing that figure as the fig argument). In this case, axes_idx
            must also be set and include keys for each of the included plots,
        plot_representation_error_as_rgb : bool, optional
            The representation can be image-like with multiple channels, and we
            have no way to determine whether it should be represented as an RGB
            image or not, so the user must set this flag to tell us. It will be
            ignored if the representation doesn't look image-like or if the
            model has its own plot_representation_error() method. Else, it will
            be passed to `po.imshow()`, see that methods docstring for details.
            since plot_synthesis_status normally sets it up for us
        width_ratios : dict, optional
            By defualt, all plots axes will have the same width. To change
            that, specify their relative widths using keys of the format
            "{x}_width", where `x` in ['synthesized_image', 'loss',
            'representation_error', 'image_hist', 'rep_comparison',
            'signal_comparison']

        Returns
        -------
        anim : matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation
            The animation object. In order to view, must convert to HTML
            or save.

        Notes
        -----

        By default, we use the ffmpeg backend, which requires that you have
        ffmpeg installed and on your path (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
        To use a different, use the matplotlib rcParams:
        `matplotlib.rcParams['animation.writer'] = writer`, see
        https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/animation_api.html#writer-classes for
        more details.

        For displaying in a jupyter notebook, ffmpeg appears to be required.
